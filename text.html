    <p class="para">A paragraph is a distinct unit of writing, typically composed of multiple sentences, that focuses on a single idea or 
        topic. It serves as a building block for longer pieces of text, helping to organize and structure information for better readability. 
        Paragraphs are usually indicated by indentation at the beginning of the first sentence.
